# Graph Traversal Algorithms in JavaScript

Learn how to traverse graphs in JavaScript using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
These examples show how to implement both directed and undirected graph traversal using adjacency lists and recursive or iterative logic.
Ideal for interview prep and understanding graph algorithms from the ground up.

## Has Path in Directed Graphs (DFS & BFS)

Determines whether a path exists between two nodes in a directed graph.
Includes both **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** implementations.

The graph is represented as an **adjacency list**.

```ts filename="has path" copy
type Graph = Record<string, string[]>;

// Depth-First Search
const hasPath = (
  graph: Graph,
  src: string,
  dst: string,
): boolean => {
  if (src === dst) return true;

  for (const neighbor of graph[src]) {
    if (hasPath(graph, neighbor, dst)) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
};

// Breadth-First Search (uncomment to use)
/*
const hasPath = (
  graph: Graph,
  src: string,
  dst: string,
): boolean => {
  const queue: string[] = [src];

  while (queue.length) {
    const current = queue.shift();
    if (current === dst) return true;

    if (current && graph[current]) {
      for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  return false;
};
*/

const adjacentList = {
  f: ["g", "i"],
  g: ["h"],
  h: [],
  i: ["g", "k"],
  j: ["i"],
  k: [],
};

console.log(hasPath(adjacentList, "f", "k")); // true
console.log(hasPath(adjacentList, "f", "j")); // false

console.log(
  hasPath(
    {
      v: ["x", "w"],
      w: [],
      x: [],
      y: ["z"],
      z: [],
    },
    "v",
    "z",
  ),
); // false
```

## Path Existence in Undirected Graphs (DFS with Visited Set)

Checks if a path exists between two nodes in an **undirected graph**, using **DFS** with a `visited` set to avoid cycles.

The graph is built from an `edges` list using an **adjacency list** structure.

```ts filename="undirected path" copy
const undirectedPath = (
  edges: [string, string][],
  nodeA: string,
  nodeB: string,
): boolean => {
  const graph = buildGraph(edges);
  return hasPath(graph, nodeA, nodeB, new Set());
};

const buildGraph = (edges: [string, string][]) => {
  const graph: Record<string, string[]> = {};

  for (const [a, b] of edges) {
    if (!(a in graph)) graph[a] = [];
    if (!(b in graph)) graph[b] = [];
    graph[a].push(b);
    graph[b].push(a);
  }

  return graph;
};

const hasPath = (
  graph: Record<string, string[]>,
  src: string,
  dst: string,
  visited: Set<string>,
): boolean => {
  if (src === dst) return true;
  if (visited.has(src)) return false;
  visited.add(src);

  for (const neighbor of graph[src]) {
    if (hasPath(graph, neighbor, dst, visited)) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
};

const edges: [string, string][] = [
  ["i", "j"],
  ["k", "i"],
  ["m", "k"],
  ["k", "l"],
  ["o", "n"],
];

console.log(undirectedPath(edges, "j", "m")); // true
console.log(undirectedPath(edges, "k", "o")); // false
```
