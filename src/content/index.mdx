# Introduction

**Advanced JavaScript** is a collection of essential concepts demonstrated through concise code snippets.

I'm a frontend developer. I had about 20 interviews â€” and I gathered everything companies were asking me.
All snippets are based on those real-world questions.

You can copy any snippet, paste it into your browserâ€™s DevTools, and step through it with a debugger to truly understand whatâ€™s happening.

What will this print?

```js filename="Promise Resolution Order" copy
const promise1 = Promise.resolve();
const promise2 = Promise.resolve();

promise1.then(() => console.log(1)).then(() => console.log(2));
promise2.then(() => console.log(3)).then(() => console.log(4));
```

And how about this?

```js filename="Event Loop" copy
console.log("1");

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("2");

  Promise.resolve().then(function () {
    console.log("3");
  });
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(function () {
  console.log("4");

  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("5");
  }, 0);
});

requestAnimationFrame(function () {
  console.log("7");
});

console.log("6");
```
