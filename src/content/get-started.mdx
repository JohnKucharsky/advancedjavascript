# Getting Started

Welcome to **Advanced Javascript** ‚Äì a comprehensive collection of **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** cheatsheets.
Explore practical examples covering syntax, algorithms, system design, and real coding problems ‚Äî perfect for daily practice,
interview preparation, or leveling up your **JS/TS** skills, all demonstrated with clear code snippets and descriptions.

> This resource is **complementary** to excellent official documentation and learning platforms like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/), and [react.dev](https://react.dev/).
> If you're just starting out, I highly recommend reading those resources **first** to build a solid foundation.
> However, you can also begin with **Advanced Javascript** to explore examples in action, reinforce what you learn, or quickly reference key concepts while coding.

## üß† Fundamentals

- Learn JS and MDN \
A curated collection of practical **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** examples, from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/).
Includes core features such as the **event loop**, **memoization**, **loops**, **recursion**, **context binding**, **decorators**, and **async generators**

- JS Native \
Reimplementation of native **JavaScript** methods, built-in features, and low-level behavior ‚Äî understand how they work under the hood.

- Theory \
Covers deep-dive programming concepts like composition vs inheritance, the call stack, functional patterns, SOLID principles,
and detailed examples of type conversions, operator behavior, and equality comparisons in JavaScript.

## üèóÔ∏è System Design & Architecture

- System Design and Patterns \
Explore **JavaScript** implementations of system design concepts: queues, stacks, reducers, async workflows, and more.

- Graphs \
Graph data structures, traversal algorithms, and visual patterns.

## üî¢ Algorithms & Utilities

- Sorting \
Implementations of common sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and more.

- Lodash \
Handy utility functions using the **Lodash** library.


## ‚öõÔ∏è Frameworks & Tools

React-focused code snippets covering concepts like `children`, rendering optimizations, state normalization, and hooks such
as `useReducer` and `usePrevious`

## üß™ Various

A diverse collection of **JavaScript** edge cases, patterns, and utilities ‚Äî from mastering `call`, `bind`, and `apply` to deep cloning,
recursive data transforms, closures, and event loop tricks.
