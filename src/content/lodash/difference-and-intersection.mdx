# JavaScript Set Utilities: `difference`, `differenceBy`, `intersection`, `union`

Reimplement Lodash's most common set operations using native JavaScript. Learn how to compare arrays, remove duplicates, and find overlaps using `Set`
and concise functional patterns.

## difference

The [`_.difference()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#difference) method returns the elements from
the first array that are not present in any of the other arrays provided. It computes the difference
by using the `Set` data structure for efficient lookups.

This custom implementation compares two arrays and finds the elements unique to each array, returning the
differences in two parts: one for elements in `arr1` but not in `arr2`, and one for elements in `arr2` but not in `arr1`.

```js filename="difference" copy
const findDifference = function (arr1, arr2) {
  const set1 = new Set(arr1);
  const set2 = new Set(arr2);

  const diffLeft = [];
  const diffRight = [];

  for (const item of set1) {
    if (!set2.has(item)) diffLeft.push(item);
  }

  for (const item of set2) {
    if (!set1.has(item)) diffRight.push(item);
  }

  return [diffLeft, diffRight];
};

const array1 = [2, 1, 3];
const array2 = [2, 3];
const result = findDifference(array1, array2);
console.log(result); // [ [ 1 ], [] ]
```

## differenceBy

The [`_.differenceBy()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#differenceBy) method works like `difference()`,
but allows you to compare elements by a specific property or transformation function. You pass a key or
iteratee to compare the objects by their properties.

In this custom implementation, we compare objects in `arr1` and `arr2` by a key (`x`), and return the
differences based on that key.

```js filename="differenceBy" copy
const differenceBy = (arr1, arr2, key) => {
  const set2 = new Set(arr2.map((item) => item[key]));
  const set1 = new Set(arr1.map((item) => item[key]));

  const diffLeft = [];
  const diffRight = [];

  for (const item of arr1) {
    if (!set2.has(item[key])) {
      diffLeft.push(item);
    }
  }

  for (const item of arr2) {
    if (!set1.has(item[key])) {
      diffRight.push(item);
    }
  }

  return [diffLeft, diffRight];
};

const array1 = [{ x: 2 }, { x: 1 }, { x: 1 }];
const array2 = [{ x: 1 }];
const result = differenceBy(array1, array2, "x");
console.log(result); // [ [ { x: 2 } ], [] ]
```

## intersection

The [`_.intersection()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#intersection) method
computes the intersection of two or more arrays. It returns a new array containing the
elements that are present in all provided arrays.

This custom implementation compares two arrays by converting them to `Set` objects for
efficient lookup and finding the common elements between them.

```js filename="intersection" copy
const intersection = function (nums1, nums2) {
  const set1 = new Set(nums1);
  const set2 = new Set(nums2);
  const result = [];

  for (const nums of set2) {
    if (set1.has(nums)) {
      result.push(nums);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(intersection([2, 1], [2, 3])); // [ 2 ]
```

## union

The [`_.union()`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#union) method creates a new array of unique values by
combining all given arrays, preserving the order of elements.

This custom implementation utilizes the `Set` object to remove duplicates and `concat()` to merge all arrays before
applying `Array.from()` to convert the set back into an array.


```js filename="union" copy
const union = (...arrays) => {
  return Array.from(new Set([].concat(...arrays)));
};

console.log(union([1, 2], [1, 7, 7], [3, 1]));
// [ 1, 2, 7, 3 ]
```
